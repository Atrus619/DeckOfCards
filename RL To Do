Things to do:
1. Design a state vector
    This is a numerical vector describing all useful information about the state of the game
    A. Current hand
    B. Current meld
    C. Trump Card
    D. Unknown
        1. Cards that haven't been seen
        2. Cards that have been played, and are no longer in play
        3. Cards that have been melded by the opponent
2. Design the outputs/decisions/heads of the agent
    Each possible decision of the agent will be a separate head and needs to be properly defined
    A. Which card to play in trick
    B. Whether to meld/which cards to meld  # CerberusAI
3. Decide on a learning algorithm, and based on this decide how to set up our pipeline
4. Decide how to properly evaluate and visualize progress
    Also clean up the human side and allow it to be played between an AI/human, or human/human.
    Preferably hosted on website or something.
5. Research stuff:
    A. Research how RL handles performing illegal actions in games
    B. Research how RL handles imperfect information in games
    C. Research examples of state vectors and how they are assembled
