# DeckOfCards
This project involves designing environments to simulate various card games in order to test out various reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary goals are as follows:
1. Train agents capable of outperforming humans
2. Be able to train agents of varying skill levels
3. Train such agents across a variety of games
4. Learn approaches that can generalize across domains and can be potentially applied to other domains (e.g. AI in video games)

## Motivation
Reinforcement learning is a field of research that has enormous potential. Two of the biggest difficulties with reinforcement learning is that it requires a significant amount of training time and does not generalize well across domains. This project aims to study reinforcement learning in order to better understand applying it to different domains and determine if either of these problems can be solved.
