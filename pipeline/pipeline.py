# Loop through number of training cycles
    # Loop through number of episodes per cycle
        # Set up game
        # Play game
        # Record along the way
    # Collect relevant experience for training
    # Train DQN or other model
    # Logging/Visualization/Track Progress/Benchmark

# Stretch goals:
    # Parallelize
    # Add complexity slowly
    # Make interface more robust
    # Add debug method to jump into game
    # Mess with reward function
    # Mess with config
    # Try other algorithms!!!

# Things to log/etc.
    # Average reward
    # Win rate versus randombot
    # Win rate versus older version of bot
    # NN weights/histograms/loss
    # Overall win-rate
